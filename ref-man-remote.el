;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Components for interfacing remote servers like mail and remote
;; storage.  Provides custom functions to use with `mu4e' to export `org-mode'
;; buffers as mail and attach files as remote links automatically.
;;
;; Remote storage management requires rclone to be available.  See URL
;; https://rclone.org/.  Not all remote servers may support generating public
;; links.  Refer to rclone documentation.
